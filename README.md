# dfcpu
A cpu thing I'm gonna mess with and work on idfk yet
## How will it be programmed?
I think I'll use orgasm assembly for it, but that's awhile away because I need to learn microcode.
## Notice: this idea came about before [sgcpu and sg01](https://github.com/segfaultdev/sgcpu) so I'm not copying
